# Banking-System
This program represents a banking system. It was incrementally developed for the "Object Oriented Programming"-Module during my University Undergrad Computer Science degree.

The purpose of this project was to learn the principles of object oriented programming and the basics of the MVC-Pattern.

I used JSON-files for persisting the accounts and the transactions in the banking system.

The GUI was created with javaFX.
